Brief Description of the Project
Students and daily commuters in the busy environment of Cebu City occasionally struggle with currency conversion. Modern modules 
are included, such as bill recognition to confirm authenticity, depositing mechanisms to sort coins and bills in real-time, and error 
management to ensure a positive user experience. Participation is increased by the system's programmable denominations, interactive 
touchscreen software that displays current balances, and user-friendly interface. "ChangePal" exhibits enhanced sorting accuracy and energy 
economy after comprehensive Spiral Model study. Thanks to its unique combination of software and hardware design, 
which is supported by promising early testing, "ChangePal" represents an important development in real-time currency conversion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives of the Project

- To develop a real-time and convenient conversion system to address the need for efficient bill-to-coin conversions, especially catering to the needs of students and daily commuters in Cebu City.
- Deliver a real-time currency conversion solution to minimize wait times and streamline transactions for daily commuters and students in Cebu City.
- To position 'ChangePal' as the preferred choice for users, its functionality must extend beyond mere convenience, delivering tangible economic benefits as demonstrated through a rigorous cost-benefit analysis
- to create a prototype that Enable users to customize how they receive their change, enhancing satisfaction and catering to individual preferences.

Testing Strategies

1.	Software Testing Description: provides a comprehensive plan and procedural guide for the testing process, ensuring that tests are systematic, replicable, and cover all necessary aspects of the software being tested.
2.	Functional Analysis: Assess whether "ChangePal" performs all its intended functions accurately, such as bill recognition, coin sorting, and dispensing. This might involve stress tests, edge-case evaluations, and other scenario-based tests.
3.	User Experience (UX) Analysis: Conduct surveys, focus groups, and user testing sessions to determine the ease of use, user satisfaction, and potential areas of improvement in the interface and overall user journey.
4.	Socio-Cultural Impact Analysis: to understand the potential impact of "ChangePal" on the local culture, especially if there are specific nuances or habits related to currency handling in Cebu City.
5.	Market Analysis: Understand the potential user base, their needs, and how "ChangePal" compares to any existing or potential competitors in the market.

Agreement

This is to certify that the project entitled Title of the Project Here  has been approved by the CpE 526 Project Proposal Approving Committee. It was agreed that the team needs to implement the major functionalities and will be checked based on incremental milestones.  It is also understood that each increment will be given specific percentage as specified in the table below. Failure to have project checking on the dates agreed is considered zero for a particular Increment. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Milestone                       |               Functionalities Included
Increment 1         |           40%             |   Enumerate the functionalities expected here
Increment 2         |           60%             |   Increment 1 plus list of additional functionalities
Increment 3         |           80%             |   Increment 2 plus list of additional functionalities
Increment 4         |           100%            |   Increment 3 plus list of additional functionalities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grading System

The team also affixes their signature in agreement to the grading system and regulations in the evaluation of the project. The passing percentage is 50%. Students whose percentage will go below 50% will be given a chance through written or practical exam related to their project. The highest grade for those who will take the removal exam is 3.0.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Criterion                       |                   Percentage
        Milestones/Deliverables                 |                       40%
        Documentation                           |                       20%
        Presentation and Defense                |                       40%
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Promptness of Deliverables
The team is advised to observe promptness in submitting deliverables/milestones to ensure completion of the project within the given duration. A delay in submission of one of the deliverables would already affect the final delivery of the project. The teamâ€™s failure to come during project checking for an increment would mean zero for that particular increment. Delay in document deliverables would mean subtraction of 10 points from the milestone item of Documentation criteria.
