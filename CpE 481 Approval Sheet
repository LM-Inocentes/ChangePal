Brief Description of the Project
Students and daily commuters in the busy environment of Cebu City occasionally struggle with currency conversion. Modern modules 
are included, such as bill recognition to confirm authenticity, depositing mechanisms to sort coins in real-time, and error 
management to ensure a positive user experience. Participation is increased by the system's programmable denominations, interactive 
touchscreen software that displays current balances, and user-friendly interface. "ChangePal" exhibits enhanced sorting accuracy 
and energy economy after comprehensive Spiral Model study. Thanks to its unique combination of software and hardware design, 
which is supported by promising early testing, "ChangePal" represents an important development in real-time currency conversion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives of the Project

- to develop an instant bill-to-coin system for Cebu City's students and commuters.
- to design a prototype allowing users to personalize their change receipt method.
- To compare and evaluate a bill dispensing module that incorporates either a sliding mechanism or a conveyor system. The aim 
  is to determine and compare the efficiency, reliability, and user experience of each method to ascertain the optimal solution 
  for real-time currency processing.
- To test coin dispensing embedded mechanism's accuracy through functional analysis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing Strategies

1. Software Testing. Description: ensures methodical, reproducible, and complete software testing with a detailed plan and procedure.
2. Functional Analysis: Evaluate "ChangePal" for accurate bill recognition, coin sorting, and dispensing. Stress, edge-case, and other scenario-based tests may be used.
3. Conduct UX Analysis: Surveys, focus groups, and user testing to assess ease of use, satisfaction, and areas for improvement in the interface and user journey.
4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Evaluate "ChangePal"'s usability and adaptability in Cebu City, taking into account local residents' distinctive currency handling preferences.
5. Market Analysis: Assess user demands and compare "ChangePal" to any existing or future competitors.

Agreement

This is to certify that the project entitled Title of the Project Here  has been approved by the CpE 526 Project Proposal Approving Committee. It was agreed that the team needs to implement the major functionalities and will be checked based on incremental milestones.  It is also understood that each increment will be given specific percentage as specified in the table below. Failure to have project checking on the dates agreed is considered zero for a particular Increment.

                Milestone                       |               Functionalities Included
Increment 1         |           40%             |   
Deposit Module 
•	The system can sort coins for currency denomination from 1 peso, 5 peso, 10 peso, and 20 peso.
•	The system also must implement validation for the coin deposits. Therefore, it has to have Coin jam prevention and alert mechanism.
•	The researchers should test the efficacy of the mechanical switch or trigger prototype. Through sorting accuracy analysis, supplementary for the functional analysis.
•	The system must initially display for the mean time in 16x4 LCD I2C, the balance update as coins are deposited.
•	The researchers should present guide questions and request endorsement for the team to commence the User Acceptance Testing.

                Milestone                       |               Functionalities Included
Increment 2         |           60%             |  
Bill Recognition and Validation Module
•	The system should have an embedded system that enables to accept legitimate bills or banknotes.
•	The system should have an alert mechanism for counterfeit inputs.
•	The system should have enabled its primary feature which is denomination change. The researchers might initially be using 16x2 and 16x4 LCD I2C for result validation.
Dispensing Module
•	The system should have an accurate change input by the user.
•	The system has separate compartments for different bill and coin denominations.
•	The system has mechanism to ensure single bill/coin dispensation without damage.
•	The researchers should present the result from the comparison and evaluation between sliding mechanism and conveyor belt mechanism with the efficacy in dispensing bill denominations. Also, answering the question, “which is more effective?”
•	 The researchers must provide the results from that survey and report statistical data gathered. This is supplementary for the market analysis.
Display Module
•	The researchers should present software requirements specifications to the advisor for validation before the software development.

Increment 3         |           80%             |   
Error Handling Module
•	The system must already the skeletal functions.
•	The system must have a return mechanism for unrecognized or potentially counterfeit bills.
Market Analysis
•	The researchers should present results from the market analysis.
Display Module
•	The researchers should present the “Sprint” of the software development for the system.
•	The system should have already the appropriate behavior of what the software dictate.
•	The software should communicate to the hardware of the system.
•	The system has already touchscreen feature for the user interface.

Grading System

The team also affixes their signature in agreement to the grading system and regulations in the evaluation of the project. The passing percentage is 50%. Students whose percentage will go below 50% will be given a chance through written or practical exam related to their project. The highest grade for those who will take the removal exam is 3.0.

                Criterion                       |                   Percentage
        Milestones/Deliverables                 |                       40%
        Documentation                           |                       20%
        Presentation and Defense                |                       40%
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Promptness of Deliverables
The team is advised to observe promptness in submitting deliverables/milestones to ensure completion of the project within the given duration. A delay in submission of one of the deliverables would already affect the final delivery of the project. The team’s failure to come during project checking for an increment would mean zero for that particular increment. Delay in document deliverables would mean subtraction of 10 points from the milestone item of Documentation criteria.
